// Contract: docs/specs/overlay.md — `CURRENT STATE` + `§0`/`§0A` (note 1: the
// module path `src/shared/overlay.ts` and the test path `tests/overlay.test.ts`
// are PINNED; note 2: the declaration is a RETURNED WRITE with the four members
// `{name, value, removal, target}`; note 3: the `H-r7` carve-out is untouched),
// the Layer declaration, `§1` (**the re-parent half is REFUSED — NO row is
// authored for it**; the only rows that touch it are the ABSENCE rows `F-10` /
// `R-12` / `I-11` / `P-OV-TP-5` and the refusal's own statement), `§2.1` (the
// FIVE exported names in TWO halves: `overlayTransition` + `overlayInertDeclaration`,
// and the types `OverlayState` / `OverlayTransition` / `OverlayInertWrite`; the
// EMPTY import census; the EMPTY seam set; the ELEVEN declared literal bodies),
// `§2.2` (the six-row `H-r8` table `P-OV-1`..`P-OV-6`, the derived `P-OV-7`..`P-OV-12`,
// the seven-token collision reconciliation and the scan rows' DECLARED
// EXEMPTIONS), `§2.3` (the verb normalization table and the whole `4 × 5 = 20`
// transition matrix), `§2.4` (the name-echo rule, the strict value rule, the
// never-consulted `target`, the no-write rule, the fresh-plain-record rule),
// `§2.5` (the composition boundary, the no-fabricated-edge rows, the entry-point
// answer `NO`, the refusal's statement), `§3.1` `M-1`..`M-9`, `§3.2` `F-1`..`F-10`,
// `§3.3` `I-1`..`I-13`, `§3.4` `R-1`..`R-14`, `§3.5` `X-1`..`X-6`, `§4.1`..`§4.5`
// (the red's mandate, its order, its stop conditions `S-OV-1`..`S-OV-11`),
// `§5.1` (the diff scope), `§5.2` (the five legs + the THREE-PART `[U]` refusal),
// `§5.3`, `§5.5`/`§5.5.0`/`§5.5.1`/`§5.5.2`/`§5.5.3` (the typed register: `13`
// ROWS / `13` TERMS / `104` declared attempts printed with their terms / the

//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// **THE UNIT'S RED SET AND NOTHING ELSE** (`§4.1`). It is authored FIRST from the
// contract ALONE and RUN before any implementation. The spec's declared red shape
// is `Cannot find module '../src/shared/overlay.js'` (or the repo's equivalent
// module-resolution failure) for every row that imports the module, PLUS the
// static/existence rows that are already evaluable — `§3.4`'s `R-13`, `R-3`'s
// config/dependency half, `R-6`'s no-importer half and `§3.5`'s `X-1`..`X-6`.
//
// **LAYER, stated first because `§5.2`'s refusals bind this file:** every row here
// is `[T]` (the repo's own node suite) or `static` — two pure functions over
// caller arguments. **NO DOM, NO ELEMENT, NO NODE, NO SHIM MEMBER, NO OS, NO
// COORDINATE AND NO CSS RESOLUTION IS USED BY ANY ROW** (`§5.5.1` cap 6(a)): the
// only arguments are a caller's state word, verb word, callback, opaque target,
// attribute name and boolean. **No window boots, no attribute is written, no
// element is touched, no node is moved, no listener is installed, and NO OVERLAY
// APPEARS ANYWHERE** (layer anchors 1/2/5). `[U]` is NOT OFFERED by the unit (the
// three-part refusal, `§5.2`) and `[D]` is NOT CLAIMED. Gate 6 is `STRUCTURAL`,
// never `waived` — **the live app CANNOT REACH this module** (no importer, no
// rendered surface, nothing written or moved).
//
// **AUTHORING ORDER (`§4.2`, followed literally):** (1) the `§3.5` existence rows
// `X-1`..`X-6` with `R-3`'s config half, `R-13` and `R-6`'s no-importer half;
// (2) the `§3.4` static rows `R-1`..`R-14`; (3) the totality/degradation rows
// `F-1`..`F-10` and `I-1`..`I-13`; (4) `M-1`..`M-9` with `M-3`/`M-4` beside the
// rows they make falsifiable and `M-9` LAST; (5) the `§5.5.1` register rows in
// register order, then the register-harness rows. The describe blocks below are in
// that order.
//
// **WHAT THE RED IS NOT (`§4.3`):** no DOM test, no visual test, no OS/media-query/
// focus test, no store or persistence test, no wiring/dispatch/MCP test, no sibling
// test and no composition-of-a-sibling test, no assembled-app evidence and **NO
// MUTATION TEST** (a row asserting a node was re-parented, released or moved to a
// portal asserts a clause this unit REFUSES, `S-OV-11`).
//
// **`S-OV-1`..`S-OV-11` IN FORCE THROUGHOUT:** no row here requires the module to
// author an element, name an attribute, perform a write or read a DOM (`S-OV-1`);
// every scan is closed against token assembly and comment-carrying and NAMES its
// declared exemptions (`S-OV-2`); no row asks for a `code`/`reason`/`ok`/`thrown`
// shape or a fifth state body (`S-OV-3`); no row requires coercion or a policy
// (`S-OV-4`); none requires persistence (`S-OV-5`); no prohibition is asserted by a
// bare COUNT (`S-OV-6`); the literal census INCLUDES the `typeof`-tag body `'string'`
// (`S-OV-7`); records are compared with `toEqual` + distinct identity while member
// values are compared with `toBe` (`S-OV-8`); no import edge is asserted toward any
// sibling (`S-OV-9`); no `[U]`/`[D]` row is offered or claimed (`S-OV-10`); no row
// asserts a move, a parent, a portal, an owner record or a returned plan (`S-OV-11`).
//
// **THE IMPORT BOUNDARY (the repo's established technique — a structural type plus
// a computed dynamic specifier, `tests/theme.test.ts`, `tests/container.test.ts`,
// `tests/owned-list-host.test.ts`):** the module does not exist yet, so the RUNTIME
// half is reached through `import(/* @vite-ignore */ …)` over a computed specifier,
// and every row fails as a LABELLED ASSERTION naming the absent module — never as a
// transform error that would take the whole red set with it. The TYPE half is a real
// `import type` at the top, which is what makes `§5.2` leg 5 — the standalone strict
// `tsc` over THIS file — the leg that pins `§3.4 R-5`(b) and `R-7`(c): a rename,
// removal or unexported name FAILS TO COMPILE there while the runtime rows still run
// and report.
